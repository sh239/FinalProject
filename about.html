    <h1>About American Fried Chicken</h1>
    <p>At American Fried Chicken, we bring you the crunchiest and most flavorful fried chicken around. In the summer of 2005 two Bangladeshi immigrants who migrated to the United States to provide a better life for their family opened about American Fried Chicken.</p>
    <p>Working day jobs by day and testing recipes by night, both partner finally opened a the corner shop called American Fried Chicken in 2005. It started with a tiny kitchen, a handful of menu items, and a whole lot of hustle. But word spread quickly—the chicken was unlike anything else. It was crispier, juicier, and packed with a flavor that lingered long after the last bite. We are proud to be a locally loved brand with a growing fanbase.</p>
    <p>Over the years, the restaurant has remained a family-run business with sons, siblings, friends, uncles, and cousins all pitching in to keep the spirit alive. What started as a humble dream has now become a staple of the community—a place where locals gather not just for food, but for family, comfort, and culture.</p>
    <p>Even today, American Fried Chicken is proud to serve the same mouthwatering meals made with love, laughter, and legacy. Whether you're stopping by for a quick lunch or ordering a feast for the whole crew, you're getting more than food—you're tasting a family's journey, one crispy bite at a time.</p>
